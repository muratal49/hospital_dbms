We used arbitrary data to populate our tables. We generated this data by defining simple CSV specifications and using large language models to extend the CSV files with plausible data. The LLM ensured adherence to all constraints (e.g. foreign keys).

Our tables are populated via this file: load.sql

data files: address_info.csv, appointment.csv, department.csv, doctor.csv, patient.csv, prescription.csv
